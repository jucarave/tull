# TULL

This is a remake of a roguelike that I did in 2013 for the trials of Oryx. Back then I coded some basic roguelike mechanics but the game didn't have anything special. I wanted to remake this game to make a better use of the graphics by Oryx and to test myself on the design of roguelikes.

This new version is made using GameMaker Studio 2.3, the old version was made using Javascript.
